## About

Meteum processes data from thousands of instruments on earth and in space. Now people can also help make forecasts even more accurate: users can report what the weather is currently like right outside their window. To get a better understanding of our technology, visit our [website](https://meteum.ai) or [solutions landing](https://b2b.meteum.ai/home).
